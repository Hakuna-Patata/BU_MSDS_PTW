The .minttyrc and .bashrc files store the configuration for the bash terminal which by default...looks gross. 

These files are usually stored in your %HOME directory which for me (Windows) was C:/users/<user_name>

Copy/Paste the files in this directory into your %HOME directory. If they already exist, you can just overwrite.
